# Contributing

Contributing to this project should be as easy and transparent as possible.

## Workflow

We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), so all code changes happen through pull requests.

1.  Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2.  Change what you think is needed and rebuild the lib `npm run build` (to develop you can use `npm run dev`).
2.  Don't forget to update documentation.
3.  Issue the pull request! :tada:
